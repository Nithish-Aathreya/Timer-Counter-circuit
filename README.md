# Timer-Counter-circuit
This circuit functions as both a timer and a counter, making it versatile for various applications.
Timer Functionality: The timer can generate precise time delays, allowing for accurate timing in processes such as LED blinking.
Counter Functionality: The counter counts external events, such as pulses from sensors or switches, providing a way to recognize occurrences over time. This is particularly useful in applications like event counting.
