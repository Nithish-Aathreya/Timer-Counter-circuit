# Timer-Counter-circuit
This circuit functions as both timer and also counter, making it as a flexible circuit for various applications.

Timer Mode/Functionality: In timer mode, it can generate precise time delays, allowing for accurate timing in processes such as LED blinking.


Counter Mode/Functionality: In counter mode, it can counts external events, such as pulses from sensors or switches, providing a way to recognize occurrences over time. This is particularly useful in applications like event counting.
